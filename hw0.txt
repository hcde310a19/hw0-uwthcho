# Reflection on writing your program (part 8)
Part 7 was difficult because I wasn't sure how technical to be. All the technical terms I used were in reference to Java which is the only language I have coded in. Recalling the correct technical terms was slow as well because it has been a few months since I last looked at code. 

I am really excited for this course! Although it was a challenging series for me, I enjoyed the 14X series as someone who has never coded before. I look forward to working on projects and learning in a more collaborative CS environment. I just got accepted into HCDE so I am still open to different areas I might have more interest in, CS being one of them.
